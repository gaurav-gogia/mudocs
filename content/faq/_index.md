{{< faq "What about stability?" >}}
The language will try to keep things simple and while new features will be added in future, the syntax and underlying philosophy will never change. Stability is a concern that we take very seriously. All attempts will be made to ensure that there are no breaking changes.

{{< faq "Yet another programming language? Why?" >}}

It's to help act as a gateway into writing more secure code thorugh a journey of writing simple programs that get compiled into encrypted byte code and then breaking it apart to understand how things work under the hood
