mutant language has a basic **REPL** for testing the language before you starting writing some real code. Its still in a pre-release state and is therefore a powered down version. REPL is not intended to be used for writing full fledged programs.

It is merely a gateway, to help new learners take this language for a test drive. Rest assured, there has been no compromise in run-time security even in this REPL mode to ensure a familiar experience that syncs with your programs written in a `mut` file.
