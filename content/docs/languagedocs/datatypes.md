[Mutant](https://github.com/gaurav-gogia/mutant) programming language supports following data types:
The language is loosly typed and it does not require defining specific data types while creating variables.

###### Primitive Types
- **string**:
Strings in [Mutant](https://github.com/gaurav-gogia/mutant) are UTF-8 encoded strings. A string in mutant is a read-only list of bytes. While mutant does not support bytes natively as of this release, it is closely tied with how [Go](https://golang.org) treats its bytes and strings.

- **integer**:
All integers in [Mutant]https://github.com/gaurav-gogia/mutant] are treated as 64 bit signed integers

- **bool**:
All bools in [Mutant](https://github.com/gaurav-gogia/mutant) are simple objects that are treated as either true or false

###### Complex Types
- **list**:
Lists in [Mutant](https://github.com/gaurav-gogia/mutant) are heterogenous arrays that can store variables of multiple, supported primitive data types

- **hashMap**:
HashMap in [Mutant](https://github.com/gaurav-gogia/mutant) are associative data types. They are key value pairs.
