#### Code through `mut` file
All your [mutant](https://github.com/gaurav-gogia/mutant) source code files will have extension `mut`, this extension is used by the compiler to read the source code and generate the compiled bytecode file with `mu` extension.

1. Create a file named `code.mut` in any directory of your choice
2. Write some [mutant](https://github.com/gaurav-gogia/mutant) code in in that file using the IDE of your choice
3. Run `mutant code.mut` to generate the compiled `mu` file with the same name in same directory
4. Run `mutant code.mu` to run your compiled code

#### Releasing your builds
[Mutant](https://github.com/gaurav-gogia/mutant) can generate self-contained, independent, executable binaries. Following are some examples:

1. Basic Usage:
```bash
mutant release -src code.mut
```

2. Cross Copmilation:
```bash
mutant release -src code.mut -os linux -arch 386
```
